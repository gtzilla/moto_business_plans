### **Time to Profitability**

**NYC**  
- **Initial Investment**: $101,300  
- **Net Profit After Turo Fees**: $3,192 annually  
- **Time to Recover Initial Investment**: $101,300 / $3,192 = 31.7 years  

**Fort Lee, NJ**  
- **Initial Investment**: $93,500  
- **Net Profit After Turo Fees**: $10,992 annually  
- **Time to Recover Initial Investment**: $93,500 / $10,992 = 8.5 years

### Additional Analysis

#### **AWD Conversion for Off-Season Rentals**  
- **AWD/4X4 Conversion Cost**: $7,000 per van  
- **Total AWD Conversion Cost (3 Vans)**: $21,000  
- **Potential Off-Season Utilization Increase**: Could increase off-peak rentals by 30%, adding approximately $4,200 in additional annual revenue.  
- **Analysis**: The AWD/4X4 conversion would add costs, but the increased revenue during off-season months could offset this, especially in mountainous or snowy regions where AWD is in higher demand.

### Comparative Feasibility: NYC vs Fort Lee

- **Parking Costs**: Parking is significantly cheaper in Fort Lee ($5,400 annually) compared to NYC ($10,800 annually), which has a direct impact on profitability.
- **Insurance**: Slightly lower insurance rates in Fort Lee (~$9,600 annually) compared to NYC ($12,000 annually).
- **Net Profit**: The NYC operation is less profitable, with a much longer time to recover the initial investment (31.7 years) compared to Fort Lee (8.5 years). This makes Fort Lee a more feasible location for achieving the goal of 20% profitability annually.

### Conclusion

The business is more financially viable if based in **Fort Lee, NJ**, due to lower fixed costs (parking and insurance) and a faster time to profitability. While the NYC location offers potential market access, the high operating costs significantly reduce profitability. Fort Lee, being just across the river, still allows access to the NYC customer base while reducing operating expenses, thereby enabling the business to reach its 20% annual profitability target more quickly. Expanding the fleet or adjusting rental pricing may also enhance profitability over time.
