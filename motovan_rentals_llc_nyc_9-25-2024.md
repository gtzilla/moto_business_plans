### Business Plan for Motorcycle and Mountain Bike Van Rental Service

**Business Overview**  
This plan outlines a business to rent vans specifically designed to transport motorcycles and mountain bikes, targeting motorcycle enthusiasts who want to transport their bikes to tracks and riders looking for off-road biking experiences. The business will operate seasonally, with peak demand during spring and summer (April to September). The primary market will initially be New York City (NYC), where car ownership is limited, and will later expand to other large urban areas.

The business will start with three vans (Ford Transit Connect XLT) and use the Turo vehicle rental platform to manage bookings, leveraging its established user base. Vans will be equipped with ramps, D-ring straps for securing motorcycles, and a pop-up tent. The option to transport mountain bikes in the off-season (October to March) will help offset losses in the non-peak season.

#### 3. **Revenue Projections**

##### Peak Season (April–September): 6 Months  
- **Rental Rate (Daily)**: $180 (estimated based on Turo market pricing for similar-sized vehicles)  
- **Utilization Rate**: 50% (approx. 15 days rented out per month, per van)  
- **Total Monthly Revenue (Per Van)**: 15 days x $180 = $2,700  
- **Total Monthly Revenue (For 3 Vans)**: $2,700 x 3 vans = $8,100  
- **Total Peak Season Revenue (6 months)**: $8,100 x 6 months = $48,600  

##### Off-Peak Season (October–March): 6 Months  
- **Mountain Bike Rentals**: To offset off-peak losses, we'll target mountain bikers.  
- **Rental Rate (Daily)**: $150  
- **Utilization Rate**: 25% (7 days rented per month, per van)  
- **Total Monthly Revenue (Per Van)**: 7 days x $150 = $1,050  
- **Total Monthly Revenue (For 3 Vans)**: $1,050 x 3 vans = $3,150  
- **Total Off-Peak Season Revenue (6 months)**: $3,150 x 6 months = $18,900  

##### Total Annual Revenue:  
- **Total Revenue from Peak Season**: $48,600  
- **Total Revenue from Off-Peak Season**: $18,900  
- **Gross Annual Revenue**: $67,500

#### 4. **Profit Calculation**

| Item                          | Value             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Gross Annual Revenue           | $67,500           |
| Annual Operating Costs         | $45,000           |
| **Net Profit Before Turo Fees**| **$22,500**       |
| Turo Fees (20% average)        | $13,500 (approx.) |
| **Net Profit After Turo Fees** | **$9,000**        |

---

### Time to Profitability

1. **Upfront Investment**: $143,800  
2. **Annual Profit After Fees**: $9,000  

**Time to Recover Investment**: $143,800 / $9,000 = 16 years (without additional financing, or fleet expansion).

---

### Seasonal Profitability and Future Considerations

- **Mountain Biking Offsets**: The winter biking market is smaller but helps mitigate off-season losses. Exploring AWD vans would increase upfront costs but allow year-round appeal.
- **Fleet Expansion**: Once profitable, expanding the fleet and introducing vans with more capacity (or AWD) can increase rental rates and utilization.

### Conclusion

Based on this business plan, the enterprise is viable, but it will not achieve a 20% profit margin after the initial investment in the early years. The plan should involve scaling operations after the first few years to reach higher profitability, and possibly targeting higher rental fees through additional features or targeting more niche audiences. 

Considering the demand in NYC, there is growth potential by expanding to other cities where car ownership is limited, and where similar transport services for motorcycles and bikes are in demand.
